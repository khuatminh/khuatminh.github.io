                        <h3>My Journey</h3>
                        <p>
                            My journey in technology began with a curiosity about how things work on the internet.
                            This led me to explore programming, and I quickly fell in love with the logical thinking
                            and creative problem-solving that software development offers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Alongside my technical pursuits, I discovered my passion for social media management,
                            where I can combine my technical skills with creative communication strategies. This unique
                            combination allows me to bridge the gap between technical concepts and engaging user experiences.
